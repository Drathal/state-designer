# State Designer

State Designer is a JavaScript library for managing the state of a user interface. It prioritizes the design experience, making it easy to experiment with ideas, iterate on solutions, and communicate the final result.

Features:

- Create your state using a flexible, declaratively syntax.
- Use collections to re-use code and make your state human-readable.
- Create both global and local component states.

## Installation

The library has separate packages for different development frameworks.

#### Vanilla JavaScript

```bash
npm install @state-designer/core

# or

yarn add @state-designer/core
```

#### React

```bash
npm install @state-designer/react

# or

yarn add @state-designer/react
```

## Usage

Using State Designer involves three steps:

1. Create a state with a configuration object.
2. Subscribe to the state's updates.
3. Send events to the state.

The process differs depending on whether you're using State Designer in a vanilla Javascript project or a React project.
