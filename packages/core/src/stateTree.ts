/* 
  ACTIVATING STATES

  Activating states can be complex. We definitely want to make
  this state active. If this state is next in the path, we 
  want to remove it from the path.

  Next we check if it's a parallel state. Parallel states are easy. 
  If state is parallel, we activate all of its child states and 
  pass on the prev / restore arguments. Don't change their 
  historiesâ€”parallel states don't need them. 

  If it's a branch state, then we'll either need to activate its
  initial child state, "restore" it by activating its prevly 
  active state, or activate the next state in the path.

  There are two types of transitions that might cause us to restore
  a state: 'prev' and 'restore'. A prev transition only 
  restores the target state; a restore transition also restores the
  target state's descendants.

  What if we're not restoring this state?

  If this state's children include the next state is in the path,
  activate the state and pass on the transition's prev and
  restore values. (We might still have a prev/restore transition 
  further down the path.)
  
  Otherwise, then what we do next depends on whether it was active 
  before the current transition. If it was active, then we'll want 
  to restore it back to how it was. If it was not active, then we'll
  activate it "normally", according to its initial value, and pushing
  to its history. */
