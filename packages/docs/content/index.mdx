# State Designer

State Designer is a state management library for JavaScript and TypeScript. As the name suggests, the library treats state as a _design problem_ first. If you're not exactly sure how your state should work, then State Designer can help you figure it out as you go.

[Learn more](/docs/designing-state) about what it means to design for state.

1. Create a state with a configuration object.
2. Subscribe to the state's updates.
3. Send events to the state.

Your exact usage will depend on your framework:
