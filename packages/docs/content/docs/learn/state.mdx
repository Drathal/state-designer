# State

At the heart of State Designer is the **state**. A state stores information about a user interface and controls how and when that information should change. It also provides tools to help you use the state in your project.

## Creating a State

In a React project, the easiest way to create a state is to pass a **configuration object** to the `useStateDesigner` hook. This hook is exported from the `@state-designer/react` package.

```jsx
import { useStateDesigner } from "@state-designer/react"
```

<LiveView snippet="state" />

This configuration object will contain everything about the state: its initial data, events, child states, and collections. We'll learn about all of these parts in the following articles.

For more on creating states, see the API documentation for [`useStateDesigner`](/docs/api/useStateDesigner) and [`createStateDesigner`](/docs/api/createStateDesigner).
