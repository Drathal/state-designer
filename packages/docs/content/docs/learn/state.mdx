# State

In State Designer, we can create a **state** by passing a configuration object—or **config**—to the `createStateDesigner` function.

```js
import { createStateDesigner } from "@state-designer/core"

const state = createStateDesigner({ data: { count: 1 } })
```

The config object will contain everything about the state: its events, initial data, a tree of child states, and collections of re-usable functions. We'll learn about all of these parts in the following articles.

Complex states can become quite large. To help you keep your config on track, the `createStateDesigner` function offers TypeScript support in editors that support it.

> **Tip:** To create a config separately without losing this type support, use the `createConfig` function. [Learn more](/docs/api/createConfig).

A state wouldn't be worth much if it couldn't change. In the next article, we'll learn to subscribe to a state's updates when they happen.
