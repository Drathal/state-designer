# Event Handlers

You can define an event handler in several different ways. As we learned in the last article, you can handle an event using a regular function. In State Designer, we call this function an **action**—and we'll learn more about actions in a later article.

```jsx
CLICKED: () => window.alert("I'm an action!")
```

You can also handle an event with an **event handler object**. This object can have many properties, such as `do`, `to`, `if`, and `unless`, that can work together to determine what happens when the event handler runs. We'll learn about these properties in later articles, too.

```jsx
CLICKED: {
  do: () => window.alert("I'm an action!"),
}
```

Finally, you can also define an event handler as an **array** that contains actions, event handler objects, or a mix of both. When the event runs, each item in the array will run in order.

Alright, that's probably more than enough alerts for one guide. Now that we know how event handlers work, we can start handling some real events. In the next article, we'll get into State Designer's most powerful feature: **states**.
