# Events

You can use **events** to make things happen in your state.

In State Designer, the states you design are driven by events. You can configure your state to respond to an event by making a change to the state or firing off some other side effect. An event can be caused by anything you like: a user interaction like a click or key press, a timer ticking, or even a message from some other state.

### Defining Events

To define an event, add it as a property of your state's `on` object.

```jsx
on: {
  OPENED_ALERT: () => alert("Hi!")
},
```

An event has two parts: its **name** and its **handler**.

In our example, we've created an event named `"OPENED_ALERT"`. Its handler is a function that will open an alert.

### Triggering Events with Send

To trigger an event, call your state's `send` method with event's name.

```jsx
<button onClick={() => state.send("OPENED_ALERT")}>Click here!</button>
```

In our example, each time that a user clicks the button, we send `"OPENED_ALERT"` to the state. This triggers the state's event named `"OPENED_ALERT"`. Triggering the event runs its handler and its handler opens the alert.

> **Tip:** As you build a user interface, you'll often find that several interactions will all produce the same event. For this reason, it's better to name events after _what_ the user did (opened an alert) rather than _how_ they did it (clicked a button). Otherwise, you might end up with key presses sending events named `"CLICKED"`!

In the next article, we'll take a closer look at event handlers and learn more about what else we can do when an event is triggered.
