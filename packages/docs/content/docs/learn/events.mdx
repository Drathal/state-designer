# Events

In State Designer, **events** are our way of making things happen. You can send events to a state in order to make changes to the state and trigger updates.

Let's start with something simple. In the example below, click on the button to open an alert.

<LiveView snippet={"events"} />

## Defining and Sending Events

In a state's configuration, you can define events under the property `on`. This property holds an object with individual events defined as properties. We call the property's key the event's **name** and its value the event's **handler**.

```jsx
on: {
  CLICKED: () => window.alert("Hi!")
},
```

Next, we use the state's `send` method to **send** an event's name to the state. If the state has an event with a name that matches the name we've sent, it will trigger the event and run its handler.

```jsx
<button onClick={() => state.send("CLICKED")}>Click here!</button>
```

In our example, we've created a single event named `"CLICKED"` that we're handling with a function that opens the alert. Each time that a user clicks the button, we're calling the `send` method and sending `"CLICKED"` to the state. This triggers the event and runs its handler that opens the alert.

In the next article, we'll take a closer look at event handlers.
