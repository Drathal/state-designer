# Events

In State Designer, **events** are our way of making things happen. You can **send** events to a state in order to make changes to the state and trigger updates.

## Making Things Happen

Let's start with something simple.

In the example below, click on the button to open an alert.

<LiveView snippet={"events"} />

> Can you make the example's alert say `"Hello world!"` instead?

Now let's look closer at how that works.

### Defining Events

In a state's configuration, you can define events under the property `on`. This property holds an object where individual events are defined as properties. We call the property's key the event's **name** and its value the event's **handler**.

```jsx
on: {
  CLICKED: () => window.alert("Hi!")
},
```

In our example, we've created a single event named `"CLICKED"` that we're handling with a function that opens the alert.

### Sending Events

Next, we call the state's `send` method with the name of the event that's just happened. If the state's events include an event with the same name, then it will trigger that event and run its handler.

```jsx
<button onClick={() => state.send("CLICKED")}>Click here!</button>
```

In our example, each time that a user clicks the button, we're sending in the name `"CLICKED"`. This triggers the `"CLICKED"` event that we've defined in our state's configuration object, running its handler and opening the alert.
