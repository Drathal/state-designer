# `createDesign`

If you want to use the same design for multiple states, but still get the same TypeScript support while you construct the design object, you can use the `createDesign` function.

```js
const design = createDesign({
  initial: "notChecked",
  states: {
    notChecked: {
      on: { CHECKED: { to: "checked" } },
    },
    notChecked: {
      on: { CHECKED: { to: "notChecked" } },
    },
  },
})

const checkboxIds = ["lights", "camera", "music"]

checkboxIds.forEach((id) => {
  const state = createState(design)
  const checkbox = document.getElementById(id)

  checkbox.onChange = () => state.send("CHECKED")

  state.onUpdate((state) => (checkbox.checked = state.isIn("checked")))
})
```

Note that this function doesn't _do_ anything specialâ€”it just returns the same object that you've passed to the function. Its only purpose is to provide type support. However, having a separate design object means you can get creative with how you use it.

```js
const design = createDesign({
  data: {
    score: 0,
    lives: 3,
  },
  on: { ... },
})

function createStateWithScore(score) {
  return createState({
    ...design,
    data: {
      ...design.data,
      score,
    },
  })
}

function createStateWithLives(lives) {
  return createState({
    ...design,
    data: {
      ...design.data,
      lives,
    },
  })
}
```
