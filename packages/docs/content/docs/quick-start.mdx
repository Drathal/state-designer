# Quick Start

Welcome to the State Designer Quick Start guide. In this guide, we'll use the [`@state-designer/react`](/docs/packages/react) package to create a state and use it to drive updates to a component. We'll be moving fast and touching only lightly on library's features and concepts. If you'd prefer a deeper dive, see our [Learn section](/docs/learn/intro) instead.
