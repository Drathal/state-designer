# Computing `values`

Depending on what you're building, the values you're interested in might not be the same as the values that you store in `data`. To make this easier, you can add a `values` object to your configuration.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const { data, send, values } = useStateDesigner({
      data: {
        value: 0,
      },
      on: {
        INCREASED: (data) => {
          data.value++
        },
      },
      values: {
        doubled: (data) => {
          return data.value * 2
        },
      },
    })
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>{data.value}</h2>
        <p>Doubled: {values.doubled}</p>
        <button onClick={() => send("INCREASED")}>Increase</button>
      </div>
    )
  }}
</Playground>

The `values` object is an object made up of functions that, like actions, accept the state's current `data`. Unlike actions, what matters here is what the function returns.

Each time the state is ready to update, it will run all of its `values` functions and return a new object—also named `values`—that contains whatever each function returned.

#### 🏆 Challenge

In the playground above, can you create a new value named `half` that returns half the value of `data.count`?
