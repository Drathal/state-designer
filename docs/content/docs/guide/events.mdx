# Events

In State Designer, events are our way of making things happen.

Click on the button in the example below to open an alert.

<LiveView code={Snippets.events} />

Now let's look at how that works.

We declare a state's **events** under the property `on`, an object where we can define individual events as key value pairs. We call the key the event's **name** and the value the event's **handler**.

In our case, we've created a single event named `"CLICKED"` that we're handling with a function that opens the alert.

```jsx
on: {
  CLICKED: () => window.alert("Hello world!")
},
```
