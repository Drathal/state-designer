# Events

We can send **events** to a state in order to make change and trigger an update.

Let's start with something simple. In the example below, click on the button to open an alert.

<LiveView snippet={"events"} />

Now let's look at how that works.

We declare a state's **events** under the property `on`, an object where we can define individual events as key value pairs. We call the key the event's **name** and the value the event's **handler**.

In our case, we've created a single event named `"CLICKED"` that we're handling with a function that opens the alert.

```jsx
on: {
  CLICKED: () => window.alert("Hi!")
},
```
