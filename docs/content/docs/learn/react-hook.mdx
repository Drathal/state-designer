# React Hook

If a React project, you can use the `useStateDesigner` hook in one of two ways: either to subscribe a component to an external state's updates, or else to create a new state _inside of_ the component and subscribe to its updates.

## External State

To subscribe to an external state, create your state outside of the component using `createStateDesigner` and then pass it to the `useStateDesigner` hook.

```jsx
import { createStateDesigner } from "@state-designer/core"
import { useStateDesigner } from "@state-designer/react"

const state = createStateDesigner({ data: { count: 1 } })

function Example() {
  // highlight-next-line
  const update = useStateDesigner(state)

  return <h1>{update.data.count}</h1>
}
```

This will subscribe the component to the state's updates: any time the state updates, the component will update, too. If the component unmounts, then it will unsubscribe automatically.

> **Tip:** You can use this pattern to subscribe any number of components to the same state. In this way, you can easily create **global** states that drive changes to many different components.

## Internal State

To create an internal state and subscribe to its updates, pass a configuration object directly to the `useStateDesigner` hook.

```js
import { createStateDesigner } from "@state-designer/core"
import { useStateDesigner } from "@state-designer/react"

function Example() {
  // highlight-next-line
  const update = useStateDesigner({ data: { count: 1 } })

  return <h1>{state.data.count}</h1>
}
```

Just as with an external state, updating the state will also update the component, ensuring that the two stay permanently in sync. Unmounting a component with an internal state will destroy that state.

> **Tip:** Internal states are unique to each instance of a component. This is useful for creating reusable **local** states.

For the rest of this guide, we'll use the internal state pattern as we learn more about creating states with State Designer. If you'd like to learn more about the `useStateDesigner` hook, see its documentation [here](/docs/api/useStateDesigner).
