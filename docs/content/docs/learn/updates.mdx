# Updates

Certain events will cause a state to **update**. We can **subscribe** to a state's updates by passing a callback function to the state's `onUpdate` method.

```js
state.onUpdate(() => {
  document.getElementById("count").textContent = state.data.count
})
```

The state will call this function each time it updates. In the body of the function, we can make changes to our project based on the state's current information.

> **Note:** The `onUpdate` function also receives the new state as an argument. While the state itself is mutable, certain parts of the state are immutable. [Learn more](/docs/api/onUpdate).

So far we've looked at using State Designer in regular JavaScript. In the next article, we'll learn about using State Designer in a **React** project with the `useStateDesigner` hook.
